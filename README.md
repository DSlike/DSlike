# Hello! I'm Daniel! ü§òüèª
Fullstack JS developer

I have successfully implemented a lot of applications and websites for various industries for both enterprise solutions and startups.

I have experience in developing Restful API services and custom data generators, as well as in implementing front-ends using ReactJS (simple landing pages, heavy constructors, enterprise control panels, and 3D digital twins of enterprise).

Currently I'm working in Sekai Digital Twins
